The RD-PH-WE sensor is an intelligent upgrade product of the industrial acidity meter, which can be used for water quality. The pH value is continuously measured and controlled. The device suits urban sewage treatment plants, drinking water, the chemical industry, printing and dyeing, papermaking, pharmaceutical, electroplating, and environmental protection.
